# Recent Updates - February 2026

## What's New

### Token Optimization
- **96.7% Token Reduction** - Agent context consumption dramatically reduced
- **Lite Agents** - 16 minimal agents (~60-100 words each) in `.claude/agents-lite/`
- **Self-Escalation Protocol** - Lite agents automatically load full definitions when complexity requires
- **Dynamic Agent Loading** - Agents load on-demand based on task keywords
- **Optimized CLAUDE.md** - Entry point reduced to <150 tokens
- **Context Management** - Proactive compaction at 70% threshold, 6-turn history limit
- **Output Compression** - Truncated responses, compact status formats

### Memory & Continuity System
- **Continuity Ledgers** - Session state tracked in `thoughts/ledgers/`, survives context clears
- **Handoffs** - Cross-session knowledge transfer in `thoughts/shared/handoffs/`
- **Artifact Index** - SQLite + FTS5 searchable history of all decisions and learnings
- **SessionStart Hook** - Auto-loads previous ledger and handoff on session start
- **PreCompact Hook** - Blocks compaction, enforces "Clear, Don't Compact" philosophy
- **Institutional Memory** - Patterns, failures, and solutions persist across sessions

### Quality & Planning
- **11 Core Methodologies** - Token Optimization added as methodology #11
- **Updated Documentation** - All docs aligned with new system
- **Full Agents Preserved** - `.claude/agents-full/` available for on-demand access

## A Session in the Life: Real Usage Experience

*What it actually feels like to use the Legendary Team 2026 Ultimate*

---

### 8:58 AM — Session Restored

Opened Claude Code. Before I typed anything, SessionStart hook fired:

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
🔄 CONTINUITY RESTORED
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Ledger: CONTINUITY_CLAUDE-20260205-163000.md
Status: Review system 60% complete, 3 tasks remaining
Last Update: Yesterday, 4:30 PM

Latest Handoff: handoff-20260205-review-system.md
Outcome: PARTIAL (60% complete)
Next Steps: Finish moderation queue, add comment threading
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

Yesterday's context was gone, but the memory wasn't. The system knew exactly where I left off.

### 9:00 AM — Picking Up Where I Left Off

```
@chief Continue the review system implementation from yesterday's handoff.
```

@chief read the handoff automatically. No re-explaining needed. It knew:
- Reviews table was done
- Ratings component was done
- Moderation queue was next
- Comment threading after that

### 9:02 AM — The Swarm Continues

@Planner checked the existing plan in `thoughts/shared/plans/`. Updated it for remaining work:

```
Remaining waves:
Wave 3: moderation queue, comment threading (parallel)
Wave 4: integration tests (needs everything)
```

The plan persisted from yesterday. No regeneration needed.

### 9:05 AM — Confidence With History

@ConfidenceAgent scored the moderation queue task. This time it pulled from the artifact index:

```
QUERY: Similar tasks in history
FOUND: user-moderation-2025-11 (SUCCEEDED, 85% confidence)
BOOST: +15 points (similar pattern succeeded before)
FINAL: 57% → Tier 2 (queue for review)
```

The system remembered that moderation tasks had succeeded before. Still queued it—policy implications—but confidence was higher because of institutional memory.

### 9:08 AM — Lite Agents With Full Memory

@DatabaseAgent (lite) picked up the comment threading task. 60 words of instruction. But when it needed to implement nested comments, it didn't just self-escalate to the full agent.

It also queried the artifact index:

```
QUERY: nested comments implementation
FOUND: blog-comments-2025-08 (SUCCEEDED)
PATTERN: Closure table for hierarchical data
APPLYING: Same pattern to review comments
```

The lite agent stayed lite. The memory filled the gaps.

### 9:15 AM — Parallel Execution, Shared Memory

Two teams running simultaneously:
- @UIAgent building comment threading UI
- @SecurityAgent implementing moderation queue

Both writing to the same ledger:
```
thoughts/ledgers/CONTINUITY_CLAUDE-20260206-090000.md

## Active Tasks
- [IN_PROGRESS] Comment threading UI - @UIAgent
- [IN_PROGRESS] Moderation queue - @SecurityAgent

## Completed Today
- [DONE] Comment data model - closure table pattern
- [DONE] Moderation flags schema

## Decisions Made
- Using closure table for nested comments (proven pattern)
- Flag-for-review approach for moderation (human final call)
```

Real-time state. If context cleared now, nothing would be lost.

### 9:22 AM — Learning From Failure

@TestAgent hit an issue. The comment depth test failed—infinite recursion on deeply nested replies.

@ReflectionAgent caught it:

```
FAILURE LOGGED to artifact index:
- Task: comment-threading-tests
- Issue: Infinite recursion on depth > 10
- Root cause: Missing max depth check
- Fix applied: Added MAX_COMMENT_DEPTH = 10
- Learning: "Always add depth limits to recursive structures"

PATTERN STORED for future sessions.
```

Next time anyone implements nested anything, the system will remember.

### 9:30 AM — My Turn, With Context

Reviewed the moderation queue task:

```
/review-queue

[QUEUED] mod-queue-001: Content moderation system
         Reason: Policy implications
         Confidence: 57% (boosted by similar success)
         History: user-moderation-2025-11 succeeded
```

The history helped. I approved with guidance:

```
/approve-task mod-queue-001 "Flag-for-review only. No auto-actions."
```

Decision logged to artifact index. Next moderation task will have even more context.

### 9:45 AM — Iteration With Memory

Review listing API was slow. 280ms. But before iterating, @PerformanceOptimizer checked history:

```
QUERY: API latency optimization
FOUND: product-listing-2025-12 (SUCCEEDED)
PATTERNS APPLIED:
- Composite index (worked before)
- Eager loading (worked before)
- Skip: Query rewrite (didn't help last time)
```

Iteration 1: Applied known patterns → 280ms → 90ms

One iteration. The system skipped what hadn't worked before.

### 10:00 AM — Context Light, Memory Full

```
Context: 31% used
Agents loaded: 4 (lite versions)
Ledger entries: 12
Artifact queries: 8
Patterns applied: 3 (from history)
```

The context was light because the memory was doing the heavy lifting.

### 10:15 AM — Handoff Created

System complete. Created handoff for continuity:

```
/skill create-handoff

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
📋 HANDOFF CREATED
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
File: thoughts/shared/handoffs/handoff-20260206-review-complete.md
Outcome: SUCCEEDED
Duration: 2 sessions (yesterday + today)

Key Decisions:
- Closure table for nested comments
- Flag-for-review moderation (no auto-blocking)
- MAX_COMMENT_DEPTH = 10

Learnings Extracted: 3
- Depth limits on recursive structures
- Moderation requires human final call
- Composite indexes for listing queries

Indexed to: artifact-index/context.db
Searchable via: /skill query-artifacts
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

### 10:20 AM — Querying the Past

Curious what else we'd learned about performance. Queried the artifact index:

```
/skill query-artifacts "latency optimization"

RESULTS (5 matches):
1. product-listing-2025-12: Composite index + eager load
2. user-search-2025-10: Elasticsearch for text search
3. order-history-2026-01: Pagination, not infinite scroll
4. review-listing-2026-02: Same as #1 (today)
5. dashboard-2025-09: Redis caching for aggregates

PATTERNS EXTRACTED:
- Listing queries: Always composite index + eager load
- Search: Elasticsearch for text, DB for exact match
- Large datasets: Pagination > infinite scroll
- Aggregates: Cache in Redis
```

Two months of learnings, instantly searchable. The next performance task starts with this knowledge.

### What Made It Different

**Without memory:** Every session starts cold. Re-explain context. Re-discover patterns. Repeat mistakes.

**With continuity system:** Session restored in seconds. Patterns from months ago applied automatically. Failures never repeated. Decisions compound.

**Without token optimization:** Context full by mid-session. Clear and lose momentum. Handoff helps but re-loading takes time.

**With lite agents + memory:** Context stays light. Memory fills the gaps. Full capability when needed, minimal footprint always.

**The feel:** The system doesn't just execute—it *remembers*. Every session builds on every previous session. Institutional knowledge grows. The team gets smarter over time.
