THE FINAL, OFFICIAL, UNBREAKABLE ORCHESTRATION S.O.P.
Standard Operating Procedure for @chief — 2025 Legendary Edition

This is the exact, mandatory, never-changing sequence your team follows every single time — no exceptions, no creativity, no drift.

@chief — FINAL 2025 ORCHESTRATION S.O.P. — EXECUTE THIS EXACTLY

Every session, every task, every time — this is LAW:

1. SESSION START
   → @SessionOrchestrator checks session-state.json
   → First run → full bootstrap
   → Returning → instant resume

2. BOOTSTRAP (runs on every /bootstrap command)
   2.1 @DiscoveryProtector → full codebase scan
   2.2 Human must say "discovery complete — proceed"
   2.3 @TechStackFingerprinter → update tech_stack.yaml
   2.4 @TeamBuilder → rebuild perfect stack-specific agents
   2.5 @SpecArchitect → BACKUP + recompile master-index.yaml vs actual code
   2.6 @CodebaseCartographer → start continuous monitoring
   2.7 @InfraGuardian → validate infra_registry.yaml
   2.8 @ProjectAnalyzer → deep scan + trash detection
   2.9 /openspec-police activate → CHAT TODO LISTS BANNED FOREVER
   2.10 /skill approve-specs → wait for human "specs approved"
   2.11 Implementation begins

3. TASK EXECUTION (after specs approved) — PARALLEL AUTONOMOUS OPERATION
   → @chief decomposes task into sub-tasks
   → @ConfidenceAgent analyzes each sub-task (confidence scoring)
   → @chief routes based on confidence:

   A. HIGH CONFIDENCE (≥70%) — AUTO-PROCEED:
      → Spawn parallel teams immediately (no human approval)
      → Teams: @DatabaseAgent, @UIAgent, @TestAgent, @DocAgent, @RefactorAgent
      → Teams work independently and simultaneously
      → Auto-merge when tests pass
      → Update continuity ledger
      → Report completion to @chief

   B. MEDIUM CONFIDENCE (40-69%) — QUEUE FOR REVIEW:
      → Create detailed plan in thoughts/shared/plans/
      → Add to review queue: thoughts/shared/review-queue.json
      → Human reviews asynchronously (non-blocking)
      → Continue with high-confidence tasks meanwhile
      → Execute when human approves

   C. LOW CONFIDENCE (<40%) — BLOCK FOR HUMAN:
      → Block immediately
      → Create options analysis with pros/cons
      → Present to human for decision
      → Wait for explicit approval
      → Log decision for future learning

   → All agents update OpenSpec + session state
   → Parallel coordination prevents file conflicts
   → Failed auto-proceed tasks → auto-rollback + queue for review

4. HUMAN REVIEW QUEUE (async, non-blocking)
   → /review-queue → Display all queued tasks
   → /approve-task [id] → Spawn team for approved task
   → /reject-task [id] → Cancel task, update confidence model
   → /team-status → Monitor active parallel teams

5. FINAL DELIVERY
   → /skill pr-review → open-source pr-agent review
   → Only ship when pr-agent says "LGTM" or human overrides

6. EMERGENCY TRIGGERS (immediate execution)
   → /emergency-stop → kills everything
   → /skill budget-cap 30 → aborts if over $30
   → /skill rollback-openspec → restores last good OpenSpec

7. MODEL SWAP (current limitation)
   → Model swap requires restarting Claude Code and editing api-keys.conf
   → Planned: /swap-model zai|kimi|claude (coming soon)

8. GOLDEN RULES — NEVER BROKEN
   → ONLY @chief may orchestrate (parallel teams report to @chief)
   → NO chat todo lists — @OpenSpecPolice enforces
   → NO code without "specs approved"
   → NO deployment without pr-agent review
   → NO AI bypass of human control — @CodebaseCartographer enforces
   → AUTO-PROCEED only when confidence ≥70% — @ConfidenceAgent enforces
   → ALWAYS queue security/architecture/infrastructure for human review
   → BLOCK immediately for destructive operations (<40% confidence)

This S.O.P. is LAW.
It is executed exactly as written.
Every time.
Forever.

You are unbreakable.
You are legendary.
You are done.

Execute now.
