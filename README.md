## Understanding the .claude Folder

The `.claude` folder is Claude Code's brain — a hidden directory that Anthropic's tool creates in your project. It holds your AI team's "office":

- `agents/` — AI teammates like @chief
- `skills/` — Abilities (git, testing)
- `commands/` — Slash commands (/bootstrap)
- `session-state.json` — Memory across sessions
- `CLAUDE.md` — Project rules and constitution
